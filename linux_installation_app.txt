### **calendarium-romanum as a Linux terminal application**

To install and run calendarium-romanum as a Linux terminal application, perform the following steps:

1) Download the repository to your local system, and unzip the folder.

2) Copy the whole folder "calendarium-romanum" (lib/calendarium-romanum) directly into the root "lib" folder on your system (/lib).

3) Copy the file "calendariumrom" (bin/calendariumrom) directly into "usr/bin" on your system.

4) If you do not how to work with Ruby or otherwise do not plan to contribute to the development of the repository, but, instead, would prefer to use calendarium-romanum strictly as a tool, you may delete the other files and folders that you downloaded from the repository.

5) Open the terminal and type "calendariumrom." A list of usable commands will appear. 

To query a particular liturgical date using the default calendar (universal-en), type "calendariumrom query [yyyy-dd-mm]."

"calendariumrom query --calendar universal-la 2000-01-01"
