# Liturgical Law

This directory contains documents of liturgical legislation
implemented by the library. Each document is reproduced in Latin,
in a form of a Markdown file.
If the document contains code blocks, these are not part
of the liturgical law, but contain code examples proving
that the immediately preceding part of the document is implemented
by the library.
